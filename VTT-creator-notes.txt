Notes for filling in the language-creators VTT file

MDN spec for VTT files is here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API

The file we're filling in is based on trint/language-creators.vtt for the edited
version of the video, which has none of the opening remarks material. That file is 
already properly formatted VTT, we mostly need to proofread and fill in some gaps. 
When this is complete, the complete video's VTT file can have the same process and
a simple script can be run to ensure the proper numbering of the segments.

The transcribed file has the entirety of the audio, therefore you will need
to cross reference the start of your block of time. 
The first section the VTT's 00:00:00 is at 48:29 of the transcription
BEGIN PART 2 in the VTT is at 51:55 which corresponds to 2:00:55 in the transcription.
I have tried to leave useful markers in the file, using NOTE (see below).

Key points: 
Always identify the speaker. There are six participants with crosstalk 
plus audience questions

NOTE (all caps) can be used inline (as this line is)
or it can be used for a block
NOTE 
this is the first line of a block of notes
this is the second line in a block of notes
avoid special characters in notes
see the MDN link above for specifics


Proofreading notes: 
Each segment must be numbered and must use the fewest digits (e.g. 1 not 001)

It is OK to remove segments from the VTT so long as the segment numbers remain in 
order, see example below.

For consistency times must be in HH:MM:SS.TTT format as this file entends past an hour
timestamps must be written completely as HH:MM:SS.TTT --> HH:MM:SS.TTT

Times do not have to be contiguous
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.00
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.250 
skipping six seconds is fine

However, leaving captions/subtitles on screen during silences allows the reader
an opportunity to thoroughly read the text

Two lines of text that use the center 50% of the screen is usually as much as a reader
can handle in a few seconds. On the other hand short captions that flash in an 
instant can be disorienting and difficult to keep up with. 

For example:

CAROL Yeah.

1673
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.879
[Participant 2] Great. There's been a lot of talk tonight

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.559

Is probably more comfortable as:

1672
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:43.879
CAROL Yeah.

[Participant 2] Great. There's been a lot of talk tonight

YouTube keyboard commands
SPACE un/pauses
ARROW LEFT/RIGHT back and forward 5 seconds
COMMA (,) back 1/30th second*
PERION (.) forward 1/30th second*

* these two are useful when you're within the five seconds you're trying to 
confirm. Holding them will let you pan through the video in very slow motion
